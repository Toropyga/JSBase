A set of basic functions for JavaScript

The functions use the loggen variable (true / false), which is responsible for displaying information about the progress and results of the functions to the console. It is declared in the body of the script (see the "Global Variables" section).

For creation and correct operation of the "Loading" visual block, the global variable bg is used.

For the functions to work correctly, you need to connect the jQuery library. The latest version of jQuery is at: https://jquery.com
